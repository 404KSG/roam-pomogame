### **PomoGame: A Productivity Game for Roam Research**

What started as a minimal Pomodoro timer has become an addictive productivity game, right in your Roam Research top bar.

It's built on a simple loop: turn your focus into a currency, then risk it for glory.

### The Gameplay

* **Earn Coins:** 1 minute of focus = 1 coin.
* **Climb the Ranks:** Use coins to rank up from **Herald** to **Immortal**, inspired by the DOTA 2 ladder.
* **Prestige for Glory:** Reach Immortal to earn a permanent **Crown ðŸ‘‘** and reset your journey, adding immense replayability.
* **Roll the Dice:** Risk your coins on a high-stakes 1d8 dice roll with symmetrical multipliers from **-4x** to **+4x**. Your rank can rise or fall with a single roll.
* **Track Your Luck:** Analyze your performance with a "stock chart" style trend graph of all your rolls.

### Why PomoGame?

The timer is **always visible** in your top bar, unlike the native Roam Pomodoro which disappears when you scroll. It's a simple fix that makes a huge difference.

### Controls

* **Left Click:** Start Timer
* **Right Click:** Switch Work/Rest
* **Shift + Click:** Reset Timer
