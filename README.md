### **PomoGame: A Productivity Game for Roam Research**

What started as a minimal Pomodoro timer has become an addictive productivity game, right in your Roam Research top bar.

It's built on a simple loop: turn your focus into a currency, then risk it for glory.

### The Gameplay

* **Earn Coins:** 1 minute of focus = 1 coin.
* **Climb the Ranks:** Use coins to rank up from **Herald** to **Immortal**, inspired by the DOTA 2 ladder.
